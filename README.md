# search-engine-in-java
This is a project related to data structures and algorithms in Java. I have implemented a search engine where you can perform compound searches to search for words in a list of webpages as text files. You can perform compound searches to return webpages that contain either all or any of the multiple words that you search for at a time. You can also perform phrase queries that return webpages that contain the phrase that you searched for. I have used AVL trees to implement phrase queries.
